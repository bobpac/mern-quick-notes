# MERN-Stack Infrastructure

Clone this repo to provide the starter code for a comprehensive MERN-Stack project including token-based authentication.

Here’s the process to create a new MERN-Stack project that starts with the infrastructure code:

Clone the mern-infrastructure repo: git clone url of *mern-infrastructure* *name-of-project*
Note that the folder created will be same as *name-of-project* instead of mern-infrastructure

1. cd *name-of-project*

2. Install the Node modules: npm i

3. Create a .env (touch .env) and add entries for DATABASE_URL and SECRET

4. Update the "name": "mern-infrastructure" in package.json to the name of your project.

5. Create a new repo on your personal GH account.

6. Copy the new GH repo’s URL.

7. Update the remote’s URL: git remote set-url origin <paste the copied GH url>

8. Make the initial commit: git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"

9. Push for the first time: git push -u origin main

Have fun coding your new project and don’t forget to make frequent commits!
